2. **Verify the source**: Click on the image to see its origin
3. **Note attribution**: Some images require credit to the photographer
4. **Confirm commercial use**: Ensure it can be used for business purposes

## 🛑 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use the first image you see** - Always check licensing
2. **Don't ignore usage rights filters** - This prevents copyright issues
3. **Don't use low-quality images** - Look for high-resolution options
4. **Don't skip optimization** - Large images slow down your website

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Download multiple options** for each section
2. **Choose high-resolution images** (at least 1200px wide)
3. **Select professional-looking photos** that match your brand
4. **Keep attribution information** for any credited images
5. **Optimize all images** before placing them in your website

## 🎯 Quick Start Recommendation

For immediate results, I recommend:
1. Visit [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)

3. Download 3-5 images
4. Optimize with TinyJPG
5. Place in the correct folders

This approach is faster and eliminates copyright concerns entirely.
