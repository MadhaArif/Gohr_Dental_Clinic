# 🖼️ Final Gallery Uniform Text Color Fixes

## 🎉 COMPLETE CATEGORY BUTTON TEXT COLOR UNIFICATION

I've successfully unified the text color in your dental website's gallery category filter buttons, ensuring all buttons have white text regardless of their state (active or inactive).

## ✅ ALL CATEGORY BUTTON TEXT COLOR ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **Text Color Inconsistency Fixed**
- Made all category buttons have white text
- Eliminated black text on active buttons
- Ensured uniform appearance across all states

### 2. **Active Button Text Unified**
- Changed active button text from black to white
- Maintained visual feedback through background color
- Preserved clear state indication

### 3. **Design Consistency Enhanced**
- Unified text color across all button states
- Maintained visual hierarchy and feedback
- Preserved overall aesthetic appeal

## 📁 Files Modified

### GallerySection.tsx

- **Inactive Buttons**: Maintained `text-white`
- **Styling**: Preserved all other visual elements
- **Performance**: No impact on loading speeds or performance

## 🔧 Technical Solutions Implemented

### Active Button Text Unification
**Problem**: Active category buttons had `text-black` on neon blue background, creating inconsistency
**Solution**: Changed to `text-white` for uniform text color across all states
- Maintained high contrast against neon blue background
- Ensured visual consistency throughout the interface
- Preserved clear state indication through background color change

### Inactive Button Text Confirmation
**Problem**: Needed to ensure inactive buttons maintained white text
**Solution**: Confirmed existing `text-white` styling for consistency
- Maintained clear visibility against dark background
- Kept consistent with overall design language
- Preserved hover effects and transitions
