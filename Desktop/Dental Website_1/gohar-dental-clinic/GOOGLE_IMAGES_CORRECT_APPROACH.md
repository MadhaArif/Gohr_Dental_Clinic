# 📸 How to Use Google Images Safely for Your Dental Website

## ⚠️ Important: Copyright Compliance

While you mentioned using images from Google, we must ensure all media is properly licensed for commercial use to avoid copyright issues.

## ✅ Safe Ways to Use Google for Dental Images/Videos

### Method 1: Google Images with Usage Rights Filter
1. Go to Google Images (images.google.com)
2. Search for terms like:
   - "dental clinic interior"
   - "dentist office"
   - "teeth whitening before after"
3. Click "Tools" below the search bar
4. Click "Usage Rights"
5. Select "Creative Commons licenses" or "Commercial usage"
6. Only download images marked as reusable

### Method 2: Verified Free Stock Sites (Recommended)
These sites are better than general Google search:
- **Unsplash.com** - Completely free, high quality
- **Pexels.com** - Free for commercial use
- **Pixabay.com** - Free with clear licensing
- **Freepik.com** - Free with attribution

### Step 1: Configure Google Search
1. Visit images.google.com
2. Search: "dental clinic interior"
3. Click "Tools" > "Usage Rights" > "Labeled for reuse"

### Step 2: Verify Licensing

4. Check if commercial use is allowed

### Step 3: Download and Attribute
1. Right-click and save the image

## 🛑 What NOT to Do
- Don't download random images from Google without checking usage rights
- Don't use images from competitor websites
- Don't use patient photos without written consent
- Don't ignore copyright notices

## 📋 Recommended Search Terms for Dental Images
- "dental office interior site:unsplash.com"
- "dentist clinic site:pexels.com"
- "teeth whitening results site:pixabay.com"
- "dental team photo site:freepik.com"

## 🎥 For Videos
- Search YouTube with Creative Commons filter
- Use sites like Pixabay for free videos
- Look for "CC BY" licensed content

## ✅ Best Practice Recommendation

Even though you can find some free-to-use images through Google's filters, I strongly recommend using dedicated stock photo sites:
1. They have clearer licensing
2. Higher quality images
3. Specifically designed for commercial use
4. No risk of copyright claims
